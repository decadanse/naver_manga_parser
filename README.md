# naver_manga_parser

old stuff

there was an algorithm:
open the site through the search bar
download images
a)upload images to yandex translator - here was the problem
download translated text
b)another way: - problem in mass automation
upload a disk to google
use google translator from images
download images with translated text 

it is possible that the version with a partial implementation of point b wasn't loaded / damaged before the code was uploaded here
